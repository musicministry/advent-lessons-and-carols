## Lesson

A reading from the Book of Genesis:

The LORD God called to the man and asked him: Where are you?
He answered, “I heard you in the garden; but I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid.”
Then God asked: Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat?
The man replied, “The woman whom you put here with me—she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate it.”
The LORD God then asked the woman: What is this you have done? The woman answered, “The snake tricked me, so I ate it.”  

Then the LORD God said to the snake:

Because you have done this,  
cursed are you  
among all the animals, tame or wild;  
On your belly you shall crawl,  
and dust you shall eat  
all the days of your life.

I will put enmity between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and hers;
They will strike at your head,
while you strike at their heel.

The man gave his wife the name “Eve,” because she was the mother of all the living.
