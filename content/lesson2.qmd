## Lesson [Isaiah 40:1-5, 9-11]{style="float:right" .small}

A reading from the book of the Prophet Isaiah:

Comfort, give comfort to my people,  
says your God.  

Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and proclaim to her  
that her service has ended,  
that her guilt is expiated,  
That she has received from the hand of the LORD  
double for all her sins.  

A voice proclaims:  
In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD!  
Make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God!  

Every valley shall be lifted up,  
every mountain and hill made low;  
The rugged land shall be a plain,  
the rough country, a broad valley.  

Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,  
and all flesh shall see it together;  
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.

Go up onto a high mountain,  
Zion, herald of good news!  
Cry out at the top of your voice,  
Jerusalem, herald of good news!  
Cry out, do not fear!  
Say to the cities of Judah:  
Here is your God!  

Here comes with power  
the Lord GOD,  
who rules by his strong arm;  
Here is his reward with him,  
his recompense before him.  

Like a shepherd he feeds his flock;  
in his arms he gathers the lambs,  
Carrying them in his bosom,  
leading the ewes with care.
