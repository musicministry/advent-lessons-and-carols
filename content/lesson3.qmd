## Lesson

A reading from the Prophet Isaiah:

A shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse,  
and from his roots a bud shall blossom.  

The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him:  
a spirit of wisdom and of understanding,  
A spirit of counsel and of strength,  
a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD,  

and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD.  
Not by appearance shall he judge,  
nor by hearsay shall he decide,  

But he shall judge the poor with justice,  
and decide fairly for the land’s afflicted.  
He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth,  
and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.  

Justice shall be the band around his waist,  
and faithfulness a belt upon his hips.  

Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb,  
and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat;  
The calf and the young lion shall browse together,  
with a little child to guide them.  

The cow and the bear shall graze,  
together their young shall lie down;  
the lion shall eat hay like the ox.  

The baby shall play by the viper’s den,  
and the child lay his hand on the adder’s lair.  

They shall not harm or destroy on all my holy mountain;  
for the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the LORD,  
as water covers the sea.  

On that day,  
The root of Jesse,  
set up as a signal for the peoples—  
Him the nations will seek out;  
his dwelling shall be glorious.
