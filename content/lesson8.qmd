*Lessons and Carols generally contain 5, 7, or 9 lessons. We need one more to have 9, so...*

## Lesson

Is there another scene that the kids act out that has not been included?

## Carol

Or is there another traditional pageant song that should be included?

Alternatively, we can eliminate this and the Second Lesson to have only 7 total. This would trim an estimated 11 minutes from the program.

::: {.callout-note}
Most Lessons and Carols programs are 90 min to 2 hours long, so we are far from abnormal even with nine lessons.
